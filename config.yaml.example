# Cache TTL (Time To Live) - How long cached data should be kept
# Supported formats:
#   - "0" or empty: No expiration (cache never expires)
#   - "7d": 7 days
#   - "24h": 24 hours
#   - "30m": 30 minutes
#   - "1w": 1 week (same as 7d)
#
# If a cached file is older than cache_ttl, it will be automatically
# removed and fresh data will be fetched from the source.
#
# Examples:
#   cache_ttl: 0      # Never expire (default)
#   cache_ttl: 7d     # Expire after 7 days
#   cache_ttl: 24h    # Expire after 24 hours
#   cache_ttl: 1w     # Expire after 1 week
